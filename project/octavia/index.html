                        <h3><strong>Octavia (VIA) revenue streams</strong></h3>
                        <p>Octavia has established a robust revenue model that not only supports our operational
                            sustainability but also contributes to the continuous growth and development of our
                            services. Our revenue streams are primarily derived from the strategic use of our native
                            token, $VIA, and various service charges. <strong>Here's how we generate
                                revenue:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Premium Feature Access with $VIA: </strong>Users can access premium
                                features, such as automated trading (e.g., executing a buy order when a specific
                                event occurs), by using $VIA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feature Voting Using $VIA: </strong>$VIA holders have the privilege of
                                voting on upcoming features and determining the priority of their development,
                                fostering a community-driven approach to our platform's evolution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Commission on AI-PoweredSwaps and Orders:</strong> We charge a commission in
                                $VIA for transactions made through our AI, including swaps and orders, contributing
                                to our revenue stream.</li>
                            <li><strong>Revenue from Moderation Services: </strong>We generate income from
                                moderation services offered to communities, accepting payments in $VIA or
                                stablecoins like USDT/USDC. This revenue is fully reinvested into the token economy
                                in the first year, and 35% thereafter once we reach break-even. The burn rate for
                                this is $35k per month.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Through these diverse revenue channels, Octavia ensures a steady flow of income, crucial
                            for sustaining and scaling our operations in the dynamic Web3 and crypto markets.</p>
